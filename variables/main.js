//Working with variables:
//1. Declare two variables: admin and someName.
let admin;
let someName;
//2. Assign the value "John" to someName.
someName = "John";
//3. Copy the value from someName to admin.
admin = someName;
//4. Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).
alert(admin);

//Giving the right name: 
//1. Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
let ourPlanetName = 'Earth';
//2. Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?
let currentVisitor = 'Finn';
